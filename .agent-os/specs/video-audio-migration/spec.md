## Goals
1. Ensure all 25 case MD files have correct video/audio embed data

4. Commit and push all corrections

## Success Criteria

## Background
The user previously had issues with wrong/duplicate videos in MD files. Videos are stored in `data-video-id` and `data-video-type` attributes in the WBM HTML. Soundcloud tracks are in iframe src URLs. All 25 cases have now been extracted and catalogued in MASTER_VIDEO_LIST.md.
